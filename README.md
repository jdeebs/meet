# Meet App

## Project Overview

The **Meet App** project is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application utilizes the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events, allowing users to search for events in various cities, view event details, and visualize event data through charts.

## User Stories

   - **As a user**, I should be able to filter events by city, so that I can see a list of events taking place in that city.

   - **As a user**, I should be able to show or hide event details, so that I can quickly view or conceal information based on my needs.

   - **As a user**, I should be able to specify the number of events to display, so that I can manage the amount of information I see at once.

   - **As a user**, I should be able to use the app when offline, so that I can access event information even without an internet connection.

   - **As a user**, I should be able to add an app shortcut to my home screen, so that I can quickly access the app without navigating through my device.

   - **As a user**, I should be able to view charts visualizing event details, so that I can easily understand and analyze event information visually.
